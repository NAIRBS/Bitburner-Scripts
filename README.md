# Bitburner-Scripts
Some scripts I wrote while playing Bitburner to automate its gameplay.

For the uninitiated, Bitburner is a game about "hacking" imaginary servers, however, the main focus of the game is automating its processes (it's an idle incremental programming game) with either its built-in scripting language or its version of Javascript.

View its documentation here: https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/netscript.html

The real playtime is probably a couple more hundred than the time listed above since I moved to the Steam version a little bit later.
